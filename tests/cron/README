cron: "Template" for setting up nightly testing.

The file crontab.txt shows the content of the crontab
I used. The cronjob.sh script executes update_all.sh,
build_all.sh and test_all.sh in this ordering. The
folder structure should look as follows

	cron +
		 |
		 + /config      -> Configuration files for the build
		 + /envs        -> Environment files for the tests
		 + /maci-code   -> Copy of the repository
		 + [Optionally: /lammps-XYZ]
