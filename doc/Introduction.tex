The Multiscale Atomistic Continuum Interface (\MACI) is a generic \CPP 
interface for the coupling of Molecular Dynamics and Finite Element codes.
It's main purpose is to connect commodity MD and FE codes and realize
the transfer of displacements, velocities and other physical quantities
between the codes.

\MACI is a fully parallel code based on the Message Passing Interface (\MPI) 
standard. In fact, to run a \MACI driven simulation, at least two \MPI 
processes are required for the MD and the FE code.
